# Fix Twitter UI

Make Twitter Great Again!

## NO LONGER MAINTAINED

This extension is no longer personally maintained. You're welcome to submit issues or pull requests and I'll definitely field those, but I'm not actively looking to make improvements.

## About this Extension

I, among many others, hate the new Twitter UI. Its rounded corners are absurd. So, this extension seeks to fix that! If you see a section of the UI I've missed, [submit an issue!](https://github.com/jbw91/fix-twitter-ui/issues)
